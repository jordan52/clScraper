Looking for a Roland piano with weighted keys. I don't know a lot about electronic pianos but I have read Roland are very good. Maybe something with different sounds  built into it. Other brands might be just as good, not sure. Not looking for a portable. Must be reasonable. Serious sellers only. Thank You

DJ facade (metro east ) $100
DJ facade  
100
metro east 
I have a great DJ facade I bought this one with the one I use. I bought them both and refinished mine and this one was set in the shed to use with a second set up but have since decided that I want to take the business in a different direction so this one will not be needed. This is Trussing (about 4 ft tall) with a piece of plexi that goes between them held together with metal tubing. it slides to gether easily and can be screwed together for better stability. The Truss's make a great set of speaker stands. On mine I left truss's the color they were (a lime greenish color) and refinished the plexi added my business name and contact info. The plexi can be refinished on this one if you take the time sand it, it gives it a great foggy look to keep people from seeing the cords hanging. This is a great set up and works great to keep all your cords out of the way and hidden so no one can trip over them. I refinished mine but am selling this one as is for $100 if you make the right offer I may refinish it out for you in the way that you want it to suit your business (I will only finish the plexi section if you want the trussing refinished I would suggest finging someone to sand blast it and spray paint it) I will be happy to send you pics of mine so that you can see how it looks finished out in a different way. 
<br>
I also had one guy who was wanting it he ws just going to use the truss's to set on his speakers and then run a different set of truss between them. Well there are unlimited posibilities with this facade. This would look great with any set up but goes great with a full truss set up. Email me for picture and I will also send you a link of my facade finished out if you would like.

I am currently selling a good conditioned Yamaha  B(&#9837;) FLAT clarinet for $200.
<br>
The clarinet was very well taken care of, plays fabulously, no bent wires/rods, and has only been used by a responsible user.
<br>
The clarinet includes a carrying case, a swab to clean your instrument, cork grease, and 7 never used Rico 2 1/2in reeds.

<br>
This is a perfect instrument for beginners, especially if you have a kid interested in taking band in middle school.

This attractively designed piano features an improved 88-note weighted hammer-action keyboard, 64 piano and instrument sounds and new Master Keyboard functions with 16 setup memories - making the RD170 a great MIDI controller as well. With its simplified front-panel and classy wooden end bells, the RD170 simply outshines the competition. 
<br>

<br>
RD170 88-Key Digital Piano Features
<br>
Â• Affordable 64-voice digital piano ideal for students and stage performers alike
<br>
Â• 88-note weighted hammer-action keyboard with improved touch response
<br>
Â• 64 high-quality Tones including an amazing stereo grand piano and more
<br>
Â• New Master Keyboard functions for controlling external MIDI modules
<br>
Â• 16 Programmable Setups allow instant recall of custom settings
<br>
Â• New half-pedal recognition for sustained playing just like an acoustic piano
<br>
Â• Split and Layer functions for dividing the keyboard or playing two Tones at onceRD-170 Specifications
<br>
Â• Onboard 2-track recorder makes recording performances easy 
<br>
Â• The sounds are equally impressive. Thanks to stereo sampling, every nuance of an acoustic piano is faithfully reproduced. And with new half-pedal recognition, the RD170 can sense pedal positions between "On" and "Off" using the optional DP-8 Damper Pedal. High-quality onboard sounds include electric pianos, strings, mallets and new organ sounds unavailable on its predecessor. The RD170 also makes a great master keyboard. In addition to Split and Layer functions, there are also controller functions built-in that allow users to play and control up to two MIDI modules simultaneously. Sixteen programmable setup memories make it easy to save and recall custom settings - great for performance. Other convenient features include a 2-track recorder and metronome, plus 16 onboard demo songs. Connections to the RD170 include stereo 1/4 in. outputs, two stereo Headphone jacks, MIDI In and Out, and two pedal jacks (damper DP-8, Soft).
<br>
Â• The Perfect Stage Piano for Beginner or Pro
<br>
Â• With its attractive looks, improved weighted hammer-action keyboard and 64 world-class piano and instrument sounds, the new RD-170 Digital Piano is a worthy addition to Roland's acclaimed stage piano lineup. New half-pedal recognition and Master Keyboard functions make this lightweight instrument perfect for professional players, while the RD-170's affordable price keeps it within reach of all musicians.
<br>
Â• Professional Quality at an Affordable Price
<br>
Â• The RD-170 is a marvel of design. Inside this sleek, lightweight package is a surprisingly powerful digital piano with features that rival instruments costing much more. From its improved weighted hammer-action keyboard to the simplified front panel and classy wooden end bells, the RD-170 simply outshines the competition.
<br>
Â• New Half-Damper Capabilities
<br>
Â• With new half-pedal recognition, the RD-170 takes on all the expressiveness of an acoustic grand piano. When used with the supplied Damper Pedal, this technology allows the RD- 170 to sense pedal positions other than just "On" and "Off". The result is more natural sustained playing that captures the true spirit of an acoustic piano.
<br>
Â• Legendary RD Piano Sounds and More
<br>
Â• As one might expect, the RD-170's piano sounds are nothing less than phenomenal. The acoustic grand piano is a real standout; thanks to stereo sampling, every nuance can be faithfully captured. Of course, there's also a selection of fine instrument Tones ranging from electric piano and strings to organs, mallets and more - 64 Tones in all.
<br>
Â• Built-In Song Recorder and More
<br>
Â• The RD-170's onboard 2-track recorder makes capturing a performance ultra-intuitive. Or if you don't feel like playing, simply listen to one of 16 outstanding demo songs. A built-in metronome makes it easy for students to stay on beat while practicing. Whether for home use or on stage, the RD-170 has the features you need most at a price you can afford.
<br>
Â• Convenient Master Keyboard Functions
<br>
Â• Whether taking advantage of the onboard Split and Layer functions to play the internal sounds, or controlling a rack of MIDI modules, you'll love using the RD-170 as your master keyboard. With controller functions built-in, you can play and control external MIDI modules simultaneously - all with minimal fuss. The RD-170's 16 programmable setup memories make it easy to save and recall custom settings - great for performance.

Ok. I just got into a car a couple of weeks ago and am looking to buy a new car. I need some cash. I no longer have the time to spend playing with bands anymore because of college, so Im getting rid of my babies... These are NOT cheap quality drums or cymbals, Everything is in perfect condition. I have well over $3500 invested into this kit, and it sounds phenomenal...

All hardware is included, every boom and straight stand, hi hat stand, snare stand, everything. Its everything you need to start playing. Its the set up Ive used for shows, practice, and just playing around. Again this is NOT a cheap set up, it is studio and stage quality, therefore its a heftier price tag. But if you know anything about drums, you'd expect that. The marks on the cymbals in the pictures are only fingerprints, I will clean everything real good before they get picked up. The Price is $2500 or best offer. Send me an email if you want more pictures or if you have any questions, or text me at 636-237-three five nine nine.

Nice playing Squire this guitar is over 10 years old but looks new. It jas been played but taken very good care of. Neck is straight and the strings are low. Controls are quiet. It does have a hair line crack in the paint that has been there since I bought it and hasn't changed,doesn't effect anything. Great for any player and a very nice Christmas present.
